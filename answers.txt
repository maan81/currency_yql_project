Questions/confirations
-----------------------
- Does the "list of symbols" mentioned in the current job refer to the 20 
  symbols used in the provided url ?

    Yes, that is correct. Only these 20 symbols needed.


- I used "minute_data" as the table name (in the procedure) for the first table 
  which stores data collected every minute from yql.
  
  Thanks!


- For the 4th script, "...script which can query..... between any two times that 
  can be set by me in the file", which file containing the two times does this 
  refer to ?
  
  If this script is within a separate file, example range.php, and is accessed by cron to run
  within this file have 2 strings where I can edit the start and end time of the range.


- In fhe 5th script, I am not clear on "deletes the previous days 1 minute yahoo 
  data" 
  
  Looks like you already took care of the unwanted 1 minute data in script 2.
  This was different to how I described doing it, but your method will work the same
  if you use the one hour data for creating your daily levels.
  
  I would like only also only a small amount of hour data stored. So maybe after daily time levels
  have been stored, it removes some not needed hour data for previous day.


- In the last part, "yesterday’s range OHLC prices" means the OHLC prices 
  between 00:00 and 23:59 for the given name  ?
  
  Yes, the OHLC between any two times I specify in the file. It could be 09:00 to 13:00 etc..
  Time of range does not need displayed, just OHLC referenced as "Range" on output page.
  
  GMT is excellent for me. :)
  
  I will accept your bid as you seem to completely understand the work.
  If this goes well and to plan, maybe we can chat about more work.
  
  I own a few large sites like livecharts.co.uk and forexrate.co.uk
  and have a great working relationship for many years with freelancers I found on elance.
